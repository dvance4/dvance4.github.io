### Dylan Vance

### Bio

Outgoing person, team player, and fully dedicated on working towards my dream of opening my own computer business. Eventually would like to achieve getting my master's degree's in computer science and biostatistics. I am a 23 year old ambitious soon-to-be entrepreneur who loves video games, skateboarding, and most importantly messing around with my computer. I have always had a huge interest in computer programming ever since my internship when I was younger following a master programmer who taught me a few simple things involving C# coding language. Ever since that internship I fell in love with this subject, even wanting to one day make it into my full time career. 

### Education

Besides that slim amount of knowledge I obtained following a programmer teaching me a few basics of the C# language, I am currently attending the Deep Dive Coding Java+Android Bootcamp held at CNM STEMulus center. I am furthering my knowledge with the huge world of coding languages and thats starting with one of the biggest; Java and Android. This bootcamp is teaching me the basics of both and even I am learning how to develop my own Android applications.
